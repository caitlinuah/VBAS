<h2>Space Journal</h2>
<p>Before changing its name to VBAS, the Rocket City Astronomical Association published a quarterly magazine called <em>Space Journal</em>. This magazine was composed of articles and essays written by Dr. Wernher von Braun, Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, and other leading aerospace scientists and engineers of the era. The art and design work was done by Con Pederson, Harry H.K. Lange, and Frederick Ordway III, who were later hired to help with the set design os <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></p>

                    <p>Summary: Observations from the first spacecraft to orbit the planet Mercury have transformed our understanding of the origin and evolution of rocky planets. This volume is the definitive resource about Mercury for planetary scientists, from students to senior researchers. Topics treated in depth include Mercury's chemical composition; the structure of its crust, lithosphere, mantle, and core; Mercury's modern and ancient magnetic field; Mercury's geology, including the planet's major geological units and their surface chemistry and mineralogy, its spectral reflectance characteristics, its craters and cratering history, its tectonic features and deformational history, its volcanic features and magmatic history, its distinctive hollows, and the frozen ices in its polar deposits; Mercury's exosphere and magnetosphere and the processes that govern their dynamics and their interaction with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field; the formation and large-scale evolution of the planet; and current plans and needed capabilities to explore Mercury further in the future.</p>

Follow the machinations of Elon Musk (SpaceX, Pay-Pal, Tesla Inc, The Boring Company), Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin, Amazon), Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic, Virgin Airlines, Virgin Records), and Paul Allen (Co-founder of Microsoft), as they re-invent the "space race" in the 21st Century.  Who will recruit the most, best engineers the fastest?  Who will dominate each sector of the launch industry?  Also, where will humanity go next, when, and why?</p>

                    <p>Summary: It is an obscure fact that NASA encouraged astronauts to capture 3-D stereographic images whenever they could, by taking two photos in sequence, at slightly different angles.  These and other classic NASA images have been processed by Astrophysicist (and lead guitarist of the band Queen) Brian May and published in this book.  A stereoscopic viewing device is included in the book.  Far from just a picture book, David Eicher's text provides a full narrative describing the history of human spaceflight from beginning to present.  This is one of the most unique books in our collection.</p>

                    <p>Summary: In August 1968, after the CIA learned that the Soviet Union was about to attempt to beat the U.S. to a manned lunar orbit, NASA made a bold decision: in just sixteen weeks, the United States would launch humankind’s first flight to the moon. Only the year before, three astronauts had burned to death in their spacecraft, and since then the Apollo program had suffered one setback after another.  When Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders were summoned to a secret meeting and told of the dangerous mission, they instantly signed on.  This is a stirring account of how three American heroes guaranteed Americans would beat the Soviets to lunar orbit, and forever changed our view of the home planet.

He traces the concept through history, from its antecedents, to its invention in Germany in the 1920s, developments in the USSR and the United States, to its expansion across the globe at the time of the space race, and finally to the evolution of the contemporary planetarium in a time of startling astronomical and cosmological discoveries.</p>

After a neighbour accused his mother of witchcraft, Kepler quit his post as the Imperial Mathematician to defend her.  James Connor tells Kepler's story as a pilgrimage, and a spiritual journey into the modern world through war and disease and terrible injustice, a journey reflected in the evolution of Kepler's geometrical model of the cosmos into a musical model, harmony into greater harmony.  Details of the witch trial add a third dimension to Kepler's biography by setting his personal life within his own times.  [Thanks to Gena Crook for donating this item.]</p>
