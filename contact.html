      How To Find Our Facilities In Monte Sano State Park
Our "street address" is:
Monte Sano State Park5105 Nolen Ave. SE Huntsville, AL 35801

Our facilities are located on a mountain just East of Huntsville in Monte Sano State Park. At the park's entrance, a fee is normally charged unless you tell them that you are going to a VBAS event!  Once in the park, follow the road to the left at the first intersection until you reach VBAS' entrance on the left just before the overlook in the park.
      
      Your First Visit
It takes about 15 minutes from downtown and you should plan your first visit to arrive while it is still daylight.  Additionally, you should arrive at least 30 minutes before our planetarium programs, which fill up fast!
 
Easiest Route
From downtown, take Hwy 431 (a.k.a Governors Drive) towards Guntersville until you reach the traffic signal at the top of the mountain, then follow the signs to Monte Sano State Park which will take you up and across the mountain on Monte Sano Boulevard, then right on Nolen Avenue to the park's entrance.
Remember NOT to pay the entrance fee since you are going to VBAS' facilities!
Follow the park's main road to the left at the first intersection and watch for our entrance on the left.
