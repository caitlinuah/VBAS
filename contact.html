    Your First Visit
It takes about 15 minutes from downtown and you should plan your first visit to arrive while it is still daylight.  Additionally, you should arrive at least 30 minutes before our planetarium programs, which fill up fast!

Easiest Route
From downtown, take Hwy 431 (a.k.a Governors Drive) towards Guntersville until you reach the traffic signal at the top of the mountain, then follow the signs to Monte Sano State Park which will take you up and across the mountain on Monte Sano Boulevard, then right on Nolen Avenue to the park's entrance.
Remember NOT to pay the entrance fee since you are going to VBAS' facilities!
Follow the park's main road to the left at the first intersection and watch for our entrance on the left.

Additional Information
Normally no one is available by phone at our facilities unless we are preparing for an event in which case you can call 256-539-0316 for help with directions.  Please use the "Contact Us" link above for additional information before your visit.
